Diving into the core pillars of the JavaScript language with Kyle Simpson's Frontend Masters course, author of, You Don't Know JS, book series. Learning JavaScript's types, how to convert between them, and compare them with == and ===. Also learning lexical scope and closure. As well as the objects oriented system (this, prototypes and classes).
